Settlers of Catan, commonly known as Catan, is a popular board game that combines strategy, negotiation, and resource management.
In this game, players take on the role of settlers on the island of Catan, where they compete to build settlements, cities, and roads to expand their territory.

The game is played on a modular board made up of hexagonal tiles representing different terrains, such as forests, hills, fields, mountains, and deserts.
Each terrain produces a specific resource: wood, brick, wheat, ore, and sheep. Players collect resources based on the roll of two dice and the placement of their settlements adjacent to the tiles.

The objective of Catan is to be the first player to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10. Players earn points by building settlements and cities, having the longest road, and acquiring development cards that can grant additional points or special abilities.
